Steps Done
1. Preprocessed text: lowercasing, removed numbers/punctuation, tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization.
2. Created a cleaned text column for vectorization.
3. Handled imbalanced data with oversampling.
4. Prepared data for TF-IDF.
5. Train and Evaluate Data.
6. Word clouds for positive/negative word visualization
